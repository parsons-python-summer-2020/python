    "## What is a palindrome?\n",
    "A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled the same forwards as backwards, like `wow`.  Capitalization, whitespace, and punctuation are often ignored, so examples like `Anna`, `race car`, and `Was it a cat I saw?` are also palindromes.\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are we going to make?\n",
    "We are going to create a function that checks whether or not a given phrase is a palindrome. Here are our guidelines:\n",
    "* Our function will be called `isPalindrome()`.\n",
    "* It will accept one **argument** called `txt`, which is a string.\n",
    "* It will **return** either True (if `txt` is a palindrome) or `False` (if `txt`\n",
    "  is not a palindrome).\n",
    "  \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can we test along the way?\n",
    "We will use the following test cases to check our function as we build it:\n",

    "The following should all return `True`:\n",
